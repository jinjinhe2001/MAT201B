# MAT 201B
Hi, this is Jinjin He.  
This repository is to share my work on the UCSB MAT201B course.
## How to run  
Move code folders to allolib_playground modules. And run ``./run.sh xxx(code direction in allolib_playground)``
## Assignment 1
In Assignment 1, this program allow the user to organize the mesh vertices using keyboard interaction:
- `1` key returns the points to the row/column positions of each pixel in the original image.
- `2` key places each point in an **RGB color space** "Cube" according to its color.
- `3` key builds an **HSV color space** "Cylinder" with the points.
- `4` key organizes the points according to my own aesthetic goals; I implemented a mesh-based sand simulation!
